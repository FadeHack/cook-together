# CookTogether üç≥

CookTogether is a full-stack web application designed to be a modern, centralized platform for a community cooking club. It replaces the chaos of WhatsApp groups and Google Docs with a streamlined, feature-rich, and beautifully designed interface for sharing, discovering, and saving recipes.

## Overview

This project was built from the ground up to solve the problem of a growing cooking community struggling to manage their recipes. The platform provides a robust backend API built with Node.js/Express and a dynamic, fully responsive frontend built with React and Vite. It features a complete authentication system, advanced recipe filtering, and a polished UI/UX with modern animations and a dark mode.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

**For ease of testing, a pre-configured .env file is included already in both backend and frontend directories.**

### Prerequisites

You will need the following software installed on your machine:

-   Node.js (v18.x or later recommended)
-   npm (or yarn/pnpm)
-   MongoDB (either a local instance or a cloud-based service like MongoDB Atlas)

### Backend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd cooktogether-backend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    -   Create a copy of the example environment file: **copy `.env.example` to `.env`**.
    -   Fill in the required values in the `.env` file, such as your MongoDB connection string and Firebase service account details.

4.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The backend server will be running on the port specified in your `.env` file (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd cooktogether-frontend
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    -   Create a copy of the example environment file: **copy `.env.example` to `.env`**.
    -   Fill in your Firebase client SDK configuration keys in the `.env` file.

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use).
